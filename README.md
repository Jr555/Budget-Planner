    BUDGET PLANNER

     
        Started sitting down for a monthly Budget ,it didn't take us long to realize something.
     Creating a budgeting process is the most effective way to kwwp your finances on track.
     A good personal finance budget planner should allow you to do 2 things: plan your days and your 
     money in the same place.
        When budgeting with the Personal Finance Budget planner,both setting monthly goals that you can 
     see and scheduling your bills each     month are really important.This is because goals(especialy 
     financial ones) and being intentional about paying your bills are related.
     When we are intentional with one area in our lives,it will spill over into other areas as well.
     When you become intentional with your money and life go hand-in-hand,Goal setting and intentionality
     are coupled together as well.
        I cannot say this enough.Budgeting every single month with your spouse(if you are married)should be non-negotiable.
     If youre single,it's just as important to be budgeting monthly.Learning how to budget prospectively
     (budgeting before you spend)is essential to healthy long-term financial sucess.There is no real shortcut 
     for this,but I promise,it will get faster and easier as you do it from month to month.
     In closing,learning how to budget your bills is crucial to lifelong financial sucess.If you are interested
     in purchasing your own personal finance planner,choose budget planner.
